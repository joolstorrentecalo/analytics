{% docs commonroom_activities_source %}

Activity shows the types of engagement happening across your community - joins, comments, replies, retweets, RSVPs - anything you can monitor within a given signal. Activity is essentially your community newsfeed. It gives you a complete look at who’s saying what and where, whether it’s with other Contacts or to your organization directly.

{% docs commonroom_organizations_source %}

An organization reflects real organizations _(and the Contacts within them)_ in the real world—not just how they may appear in someone’s database. This means if you have multiple accounts and opportunities from Salesforce related to a single company, or if you have multiple domains related to a company for product usage, all of these will be merged into a single organization profile.
